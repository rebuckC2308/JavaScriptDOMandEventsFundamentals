# JavaScriptDOMandEventsFundamentals
I began a Udemy course to continue to build on the foundation that I've learned while in LaunchCode's LC 101 and this course has been very helpful.  While I have been finishing up my capstone project with my group amongst other things I have been slowly chipping away at this course and I am excited to start building projects to gain hands on experience.
